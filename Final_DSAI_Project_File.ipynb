    "**Code Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   ***Data Preparation:***\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The dataset is prepared by selecting specific predictor variables: pl_orbsmax (semi-major axis), st_mass (stellar mass), and pl_orbeccen (eccentricity).\n",
    "*   ***Kepler's Law Transformation:*** Since Kepler's Third Law relates orbital period to the semi-major axis raised to the power of 3/2, the code applies this transformation to pl_orbsmax (X['pl_orbsmax'] = X['pl_orbsmax'] ** (3 / 2)) to better align with theoretical expectations.\n",
    "*   The data is then split into training and test sets to allow for independent evaluation on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.   ***Model Initialization:*** The code initializes several models with different approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   ***Linear Regression:*** Finds a linear relationship between predictors and the target variable (pl_orbper). It serves as a baseline, providing insight into linear trends in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   ***Polynomial Regression:*** Extends Linear Regression by adding polynomial terms (degree 2), allowing it to capture more complex, non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   ***Decision Tree Regressor:*** A non-linear model that splits data into branches based on conditions in the predictor variables, capturing intricate patterns but potentially overfitting without pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   ***Random Forest Regressor:*** An ensemble of decision trees that averages predictions from multiple trees trained on random subsets of data, improving accuracy and reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   ***Gradient Boosting Regressor:*** An ensemble method that builds trees sequentially, each focusing on correcting errors from previous trees. It’s powerful for capturing complex patterns and is effective when properly tuned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.   ***Cross-Validation (Folding):***\n",
    "\n",
    "* The code uses 5-fold cross-validation to train and evaluate each model across multiple data splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In 5-fold cross-validation, the data is divided into 5 subsets (folds). Each model is trained on 4 folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process repeats 5 times, with each fold serving as the test set once.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Advantages: Cross-validation provides a more reliable assessment of model performance by reducing bias and ensuring that the model is tested on all data points. It also helps in identifying any overfitting, as each model must generalize across different parts of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The results (Mean Squared Error and R²) for each fold are averaged, providing a comprehensive measure of model accuracy and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.   ***Model Training and Evaluation:*** Each model is trained and evaluated on the training and test sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "*    ***Mean Squared Error (MSE)*** indicates the average squared difference between predicted and actual values, where lower values represent higher accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    ***R² Score*** measures the proportion of variance in pl_orbper explained by the model, with higher values indicating better explanatory power.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each model's results on different folds (from cross-validation) are examined, and metrics like MSE and R² are printed for each fold to assess performance consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ***Stacking Ensemble Model:***\n",
    "\n",
    "*   ***Stacking*** is an ensemble technique that combines predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy. Here, each base model (Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) provides predictions, which are then used as inputs to a meta-model (Random Forest Regressor).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The stacking ensemble benefits from the strengths of each model, creating a more robust prediction by compensating for the individual weaknesses of each base model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The final stacking model is trained using the cross-validated predictions from the base models, allowing it to leverage multiple perspectives (linear, non-linear, and complex patterns) in its final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. ***Final Evaluation and Visualization:***\n",
    "\n",
    "* After training, the stacking model is evaluated on the test set to determine its performance relative to the individual models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A plot of actual vs. predicted values is generated, showing how closely the model’s predictions align with actual values. Ideally, points would lie along the \"Perfect Fit\" line, with deviations indicating prediction errors."

    "\n",
    "***st_met (Stellar Metallicity):***\n",
    "*   ***Observation:*** There is no clear pattern or correlation between st_met and pl_orbper. Most points are clustered near low values of pl_orbper, and the values of st_met are spread out without any visible trend.\n",
    "*   ***Theoretical Support:*** Stellar metallicity refers to the abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in a star. While metallicity can affect the formation and composition of planets, it does not impact the gravitational forces or mechanics that determine the orbital period. Thus, it’s expected to have minimal influence on pl_orbper.\n",

    "*   ***Observation:*** Similar to st_met, there is no clear relationship between st_logg and pl_orbper. Points are dispersed without any noticeable trend or pattern, indicating that variations in stellar surface gravity do not correlate with orbital period.\n",
    "*   ***Theoretical Support:*** Stellar surface gravity reflects the gravitational pull at the star’s surface. While it indirectly relates to stellar mass and radius, it doesn’t directly influence the orbital period of planets. Orbital period is primarily a function of the semi-major axis and stellar mass, not surface gravity.\n",

    "*   ***Primary Predictor:***  pl_orbsmax (Orbit Semi-Major Axis)\n",
    "*   ***Secondary Predictor:***  st_mass (Stellar Mass)\n",
    "*   ***Minor Influence:***  pl_orbeccen (Orbital Eccentricity)\n",

    "These three variables, particularly pl_orbsmax, align well with theoretical principles and also have been visualised here. All other variables have negligible impact and can likely be excluded from the predictive model without affecting accuracy.\n",
